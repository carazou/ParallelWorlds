    <h2>Parallel Worlds</h2>
    <p>How was I supposed to come up with 50 questions around design? For the first week, I searched on Behance and generated questions about the skills of design and job strategies. I was proved that not acting as a contemporary designer. From the
      pictures I showed to my classmates, I got “repetition” as my identified word. For the second week, I tried to dig out the deep meaning of repetition. </p>

    <br>
    <p>Why do people like repetition? <br>
How can we communicate effectively? By repeating it again and again? Clearly not. <br>
Color, pattern, font, they are all repeatedly used in the same project, why? <br>
Is life about repetition? Because we are repeating our routines day by day, week by week. <br>
Is repetition to emphasize? After the repetition of day by day, what is the meaning of life? <br>
Is repetition a sense of safety? Because after practicing daily, we would be more confident. <br>
Does this world have invisible ghosts living with us? <br>
Why does the universe contain so many planets? <br>
How many planets are there in the universe? <br>
Is there any creature living on another planet that we have not known? <br>
Do we have parallel worlds? <br>
Which planet are you living on? <br>
Are our hearts planets? Should I prevent myself from colliding with yours? <br>
What am I doing in another world? <br>
What did I do yesterday? What will I do tomorrow? <br>
Why do we have two eyes? <br>
Why are we living in similar concrete buildings? <br>
Is the purpose of being together to alleviate repeated loneliness? <br>
I beg your pardon?</p>

      <p>Developing concepts is the most important thing in grad schools, do not be limited by present job requirements, because those are skills, not concepts. Skills can be learned in the future, but concept developing requires the environment
        which is a condition may disappear in the real workspace. Grad schools are the places where to teach you to dream boldly.</p><br>

      <p>I learned how to come up with questions. Questioning everything by following a line,
        this line would lead you to the unknown realm. I have not thought about a poster
        could be an installation. This project helps me to question, to think, to find
        answers. I would use this way of thinking in my future projects.</p><br><br>
